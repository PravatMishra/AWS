VPC Overview
-----------------
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) lets you provision a logically isolated section of the Amazon Web Service Cloud where you can 
launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. You have complete control over your virtual networking environment, 
including selection of your own IP address range, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways.
